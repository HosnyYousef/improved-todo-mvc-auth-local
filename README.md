 To enable SMS notifications, you will need to provide a Twilio account (https://www.twilio.com/). If you choose not to use this feature, you don't need to add the variables starting with 'TWILIO_' to your .env file.

- Create a `.env` file and add the following as `key: value` 
  - PORT: 2121 (can be any port example: 3000)
